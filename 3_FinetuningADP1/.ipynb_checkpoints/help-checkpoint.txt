Hi,

some information about DgoA. This is the protein that is in the ADP-1 bacteria. DgoA_BLAST.fasta was taken from NCBI and it consists of 3617 sequences. The plan is to artificially mutate each of these guys with the following SNP mutations one at a time:

1
F33I
Auxotroph
-
2
D58N
Auxotroph
-
3
Q72H
Auxotroph
-
4
A75V
Auxotroph
-
5
V85A
Auxotroph
-
6
V154F
Auxotroph
-
7
Y180F

this is gonna make a pretty gnarly dataset. 7 * 3617 sequences. so 25319 total sequences. i'll do a 80 10 10 split like in my previous finetuning and then prob use esm2 and progen2 at the 150M so it doesn't take too long. also cos 650M is not as effective (afaik).
